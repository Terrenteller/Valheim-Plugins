### No Unarmed Combat | [Settings](NoUnarmedCombat/NoUnarmedCombat.cs)

Vikings may love to fight and throwing hands is a great way to start a brawl, but actual weapons are considerably more effective. The base function of this mod is to prevent the player from punching at all, because since when is that what you ever wanted to do? By default, sheathed equipment or gear from your toolbar will be equipped instead of trying to cast fist on the nearest empty space, wooden wall, or seeker soldier.

### Ping Tweaks | [Settings](PingTweaks/PingTweaks.cs)

Stops the chat box from appearing when anyone pings anything, prevents the player's own pings from being broadcast to everyone without a modifier key, and shows map marker text when markers are pinged.

### Restful Arrival | [Settings](RestfulArrival/RestfulArrival.cs)

Removes the delay between resting and rested upon joining a world.

### Tar Tweaks | [Settings](TarTweaks/TarTweaks.cs)

Vanilla tar is simultaneously too punishing and not punishing enough. First, you can swim in tar, so what sense does it make for items to be stuck in tar? Second, you can swim in tar, and what sense does that make at all? This mod allows items to be interactively and automatically taken from tar while greatly restricting movement when in or dripping with tar.
