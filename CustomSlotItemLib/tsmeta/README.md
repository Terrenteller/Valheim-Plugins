Allows items to be equipped in custom slots defined by other plugins or a configuration value.

This is an update and drop-in replacement of [CustomSlotItemLib](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/nearbear/CustomSlotItemLib/) originally written by [nearbear](https://github.com/nearbear/ValheimBepinexMods/tree/main/CustomSlotItemLib). It was broken by an unknown game update and appears to be abandoned. More information can be found in the original [README](https://github.com/nearbear/ValheimBepinexMods/blob/main/CustomSlotItemLib/Package/README.md).

WARNING: Addons made for the original plugin, like [WishboneSlot](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/nearbear/WishboneSlot/) by [nearbear](https://github.com/nearbear/ValheimBepinexMods/tree/main/WishboneSlot) and [WisplightSlot](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/ValheimAddicts/WisplightSlot/) by [ValheimAddicts](https://github.com/DerNap/ValheimAddicts/tree/main/WisplightSlot), are compatible with this one, BUT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE THROUGH MOD MANAGERS DUE TO THEIR THUNDERSTORE DEPENDENCY ON THE ORIGINAL PLUGIN. The functionality of these two is provided by default to account for this.
