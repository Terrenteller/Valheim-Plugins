PingTweaks improves the appearance and behavior of pings.

- Pings are not broadcast to other players without a modifier key
- Map marker pings show the marker text
- Pings are sent and map markers are created with proper elevation data
- Pings show distance in meters
- Ping duration may be changed
- In-world ping text color may be changed
- Pings from other players may be pinned by double-clicking on them (persistence optional)

PingTweaks is client-side but works better when all clients have it.
