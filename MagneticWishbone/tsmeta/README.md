Think the Wishbone looks a bit like a horseshoe magnet? Think no-cost auto-pickup range-extending plugins are too OP? Want that feeling of pride and accomplishment hogging another precious inventory slot?

MagneticWishbone adds three highly-configurable levels of item magnet upgrades to the Wishbone. The first upgrade, meant to be a basic magnet, is made at a forge and increases the auto-pickup radius to that of the normal maximum interaction distance (five meters). The second upgrade, meant to be an electromagnet, is made at an artisan table and increases the radius to ten meters. The third upgrade, meant to be a magical magnet, is a placeholder and disabled by default. The Wishbone must be equipped, of course.

Because this plugin does not add new assets it is perfectly safe to use in a multiplayer environment. Clients without this plugin receive no benefits from equipping an upgraded Wishbone. Servers with this plugin will enforce recipes and radii.
