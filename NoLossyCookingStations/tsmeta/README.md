Helps prevent cooking station and fermenter network lag from eating your food by:
1. Forcefully taking network ownership of the interactable object
2. Limiting the rate at which items can be added
3. Dumping overflow back into the world

Also works for "Smelter" interactables like blast furnaces and windmills. Clients which do not have this plugin will still benefit from it when the network owner of an interactable object does have this plugin.
