InputTweaks is a Valheim clone of Mouse Wheelie, a remake of Inventory Tweaks, and a dash of default Minecraft controls.

By default:
- Split and move actions are swapped so that [SHIFT] is move and [CTRL] is split
- [SHIFT] + [LMB] moves/drops items under the cursor
	- [CTRL], in addition, will filter to items similar to the first
- [CTRL] + [LMB|RMB] opens the split dialog for the item under the cursor
- [LMB] drag will divide the stack on the cursor into applicable slots
- [RMB] drag will move one item from the cursor into applicable slots
- [LMB] double-click on an item will collect similar items from other stacks
- [RMB] with an item on the cursor outside of the inventory will drop a single item
- [Q] will drop a single item from the stack beneath the cursor
	- This conflicts with auto-run out-of-the-box
- Mouse wheel pulls/pushes items under the cursor
- Mouse wheel increments/decrements the split dialog

Other plugins that deal with the inventory and modifier keys may be configured to be compatible with InputTweaks, such as SmartContainers' route-on-move feature. Please check configuration options if you encounter input conflicts before reporting incompatibilities.
